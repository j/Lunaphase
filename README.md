## Moon Phase

This is a super simple moon calendar I made to experiment with D3, and because I think they're beautiful art!

It uses D3's [`geoOrthographic`](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#geoOrthographic) projection to render the moons, and [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) to calculate the moon phases.
